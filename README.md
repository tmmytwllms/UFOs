## Overview
The purpose of this project was to create a functioning webpage of UFO sighting data. The webpage also includes a title with an image for the background, and a brief introduction to the page. This webpage was created with filters for multiple fields in the data set, and returned data on the webpage based on the input of the filter.

<br/>

## Results
Two Javascript files and one HTML file were used to build the structure and functionality of the webpage. One Javascript file contained all of the UFO sighting data, which was broken down by date, city, state, country, shape, duration, and comments regarding the sighting. Filters were also added to the page for date, city, state, country, and shape, which detect changes in the filter inputs. The filters also contain placeholder data, to represent the input format that the filter expects. If no data is input for a filter, the webpage will use the original data in that field that meets the other filter's criteria.
